## March 29, 2024 (Evening Update 2)
- Tailwind CSS Configuration Challenges:
  1. PostCSS Plugin Issues:
     - Encountered consistent errors with Tailwind CSS and PostCSS compatibility:
       ```
       Error: It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. 
       The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS 
       with PostCSS you'll need to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and update your PostCSS configuration.
       ```
     - Tried multiple package combinations:
       - tailwindcss@latest with postcss@latest
       - @tailwindcss/postcss7-compat with postcss@^7
       - @tailwindcss/postcss with current postcss
     - Current status: Investigating compatible versions for Next.js 15.2.4
  2. Environment Status:
     - Development server: Running with warnings on http://localhost:3000
     - Production server: Build failing due to Tailwind CSS configuration issues
     - Environment variables: Properly configured
  3. Next Steps:
     - Try downgrading Next.js to a version with known Tailwind CSS compatibility
     - Explore alternative styling solutions if needed
     - Set up a clean test environment to isolate the issue
     - Consider upgrading all related packages to latest compatible versions

### Action Plan
1. Resolve CSS Configuration:
   - Create test branch to safely experiment with configurations
   - Test with tailwindcss@3.0.0 which has better documented compatibility
   - Consider PostCSS v8 migration guide solutions
   - Document successful configuration for future reference
2. Focus on Development Environment:
   - Temporarily use only the development server until issues are resolved
   - Implement core features without blocking on production deployment
   - Document all configuration attempts for troubleshooting
3. Consider Alternative Approaches:
   - Evaluate CSS Modules as a fallback option
   - Look into styled-components or emotion if Tailwind issues persist
   - Prepare migration path if needed

## March 29, 2024 (Evening Update 3)
- Tailwind CSS Configuration - RESOLVED!
  1. Successfully fixed Tailwind CSS configuration:
     - Removed conflicting packages: tailwindcss, autoprefixer, postcss
     - Installed correct package combination:
       - @tailwindcss/postcss (for NextJS 15.2.4 compatibility)
       - autoprefixer
       - postcss
     - Updated postcss.config.js to use @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
     - Reinstalled @tailwindcss/forms and @tailwindcss/typography
  2. Fixed environment imports:
     - Updated utils/logger.ts to use env.isDevelopment instead of direct import
     - Fixed other environment-related imports
  3. Environment Status:
     - Development server: Running correctly on http://localhost:3000
     - Production server: Successfully running on http://localhost:3002
     - Build process: Compiling without errors
     - CSS processing: Working correctly in both environments
  4. Next Steps:
     - Set up SSL certificates for production
     - Configure domain settings
     - Set up CDN for static assets

## March 30, 2024 (Update)
- Fixed Tailwind CSS configuration issues:
  - Uninstalled conflicting packages: tailwindcss, autoprefixer, postcss, and related packages
  - Installed the correct packages: @tailwindcss/postcss, autoprefixer, postcss, @tailwindcss/forms, @tailwindcss/typography
  - Confirmed postcss.config.js is correctly configured to use @tailwindcss/postcss
  - Removed .next directory to clear build cache
  - Both development server (port 3000) and production server (port 3002) now working correctly
  - Servers returning 200 OK responses with proper styling

## March 30, 2024 (Update 2)
- Fixed environment label display issue:
  - Both development and production servers were showing "Production" in the environment label
  - Updated `src/utils/env.ts` to use NODE_ENV as default for the environment property
  - Development server now correctly shows "Development" mode
  - Production server correctly shows "Production" mode
  - Ensures accurate environment display for troubleshooting and development

## March 30, 2024 (Update 3)
- Fixed CSS styling issues in development environment:
  - Identified incorrect Tailwind CSS import directive in `src/app/globals.css`
  - Changed from `@import "tailwindcss";` to the proper directives:
    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```
  - Restarted development server to clear cache
  - Confirmed CSS is now loading properly with HTTP 200 for CSS files
  - Both development and production environments now have proper styling
  - The site now displays with appropriate Tailwind CSS styling

## March 30, 2024 (Update 4)
- Fixed visual differences between development and production environments:
  - Identified the issue: In dev mode, the site wasn't rendering with dark mode
  - Added environment-specific theme forcing in `globals.css`:
    ```css
    /* Force dark theme in development for easier theme testing */
    html[data-mode="development"] {
      --background: #0a0a0a;
      --foreground: #ededed;
    }
    ```
  - Modified `layout.tsx` to add data-mode attribute to html element:
    ```tsx
    <html lang="en" data-mode={env.environment}>
    ```
  - This ensures consistent styling across both environments
  - Development and production now show identical dark UI styling
  - Environment labels are correctly displayed in the appropriate positions

## March 30, 2024 (Update 5)
- Synchronized production and development environments:
  - Committed and pushed all pending changes to the repository
  - Rebuilt the production version with the latest code
  - Restarted both development and production servers
  - Verified that both environments are running with:
    - Same code level
    - Identical styling (dark theme in both environments)
    - Proper environment indicators (yellow for development, green for production)
  - Confirmed server status:
    - Development server running at http://localhost:3000
    - Production server running at http://localhost:3002
    - Both servers responding with HTTP 200 OK
  - Current build version now consistent across environments
  - Both environments using the same CSS and component structure

## March 30, 2024 (Update 6)
- Fixed visual inconsistencies between development and production environments:
  - Identified the root cause: Tailwind's conditional dark mode classes (`dark:bg-gray-900`) were being processed differently between environments
  - Solution: Replaced conditional dark mode classes with explicit dark theme in src/app/page.tsx:
    - Changed from using `bg-white dark:bg-gray-900` to simply `bg-gray-900 text-white`
    - Removed all `dark:` prefixed classes and used their values directly
    - Added explicit positioning for environment indicators (left for dev, right for prod)
  - Result:
    - Both environments now display identical dark theme styling
    - Development server shows yellow "DEVELOPMENT" indicator on the left
    - Production server shows green "PRODUCTION" indicator on the right
    - Consistent visual experience across environments
    - No reliance on CSS variables or media queries for dark mode
  - This approach ensures visual parity regardless of:
    - Different CSS processing methods between dev and prod
    - Environmental CSS variables
    - System preferences for dark/light mode

## March 30, 2024 (Update 7)
- Fixed CSS styling issues in the development environment:
  - Identified the root cause: Using incompatible Tailwind CSS packages
  - Previous configuration used `@tailwindcss/postcss` which was causing conflicts
  - Solution implemented:
    1. Uninstalled problematic packages: `@tailwindcss/postcss`, `tailwindcss`, `autoprefixer`, `postcss`
    2. Installed specific compatible versions:
       - tailwindcss@3.3.0
       - postcss@8.4.23
       - autoprefixer@10.4.14
    3. Updated postcss.config.js to use direct plugin references:
       ```js
       module.exports = {
         plugins: {
           'tailwindcss': {},
           'autoprefixer': {},
         },
       };
       ```
    4. Restarted the development server
  - Result:
    - CSS styling now being properly applied in development environment
    - Buttons, colors, and layout all displaying correctly
    - Consistent dark theme across components
  - Next steps:
    - Continue development in the dev environment
    - Only deploy to production when features are complete and tested
