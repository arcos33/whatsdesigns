   - Ensured proper server startup verification

### Issues Fixed
1. **Server Restart Issue**
   - Problem: Script was restarting the entire system instead of just the servers
   - Solution: Modified script to stop and restart the servers only
   - Verification: Successfully restarted both development and production servers

2. **Production Server Build Issue**
   - Problem: Production server failed to start due to missing build
   - Solution: Added build step before starting production server
   - Verification: Production server successfully starts on port 3001

3. **Logging Issues**
   - Problem: Log directory did not exist, causing script errors
   - Solution: Created logs directory and initialized log files
   - Verification: All logs are now properly written to the logs directory

### Next Steps
1. Update LaunchAgent configuration to use the improved restart script
2. Add better error handling for build failures
3. Add monitoring for server health
4. Implement log rotation for log files
5. Add automatic cleanup of old log files
6. Retroactively document previous implementation attempts
7. Integrate implementation tracking into development workflow
