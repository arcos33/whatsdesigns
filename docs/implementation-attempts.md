# Implementation Attempts and Outcomes

This document tracks various implementation approaches for features, documenting both successful and unsuccessful attempts to provide context and learning for future development.

## Server Management Scripts

### Feature: Restart Script

#### Attempt 1: System Restart Approach
**Date:** 2024-03-26
**Code Approach:** Script designed to restart the entire system after stopping services
**Issues Encountered:**
- Excessive downtime during system restart
- User disruption from full system restart
- Unnecessary reboot of unrelated services
**Reasons for Failure:**
- Approach was too heavy-handed for the requirement
- System restart required user intervention
- Lost developer productivity during restart
**Key Learnings:**
- Server management should be isolated to only necessary processes
- Prefer targeted service restarts over system restarts
- Maintain separation between development and production environments

#### Final Solution: Service-Only Restart
**Date:** 2024-03-26
**Code Approach:** Script to stop, build, and restart only the necessary services
**Why This Worked:**
- Only affected the specific services that needed restarting
- Maintained isolated development and production environments
- Included a build step for production to ensure up-to-date deployment
- Preserved system state and other applications
**Performance Considerations:**
- Added logging to track restart process
- Created directory structure for logs
- Implemented proper error handling
- Added notification system for key events

### Feature: Automatic Startup

#### Attempt 1: Direct Script Execution
**Date:** 2024-03-26
**Code Approach:** Direct script execution without proper environment setup
**Issues Encountered:**
- Script failed to find required files
- Environment variables not properly loaded
- Process not properly persisted after terminal closed
**Reasons for Failure:**
- Did not account for different execution environments
- Missing proper directory structure for logs
- No error handling for missing prerequisites
**Key Learnings:**
- Scripts need robust environment validation
- Directory structure must be created before operations
- Proper error handling is essential for automation

#### Final Solution: LaunchAgent Configuration
**Date:** 2024-03-26
**Code Approach:** MacOS LaunchAgent with controlled script execution
**Why This Worked:**
- Utilized system-level service management
- Properly defined working directory and environment
- Implemented logging and error handling
- Created separate scripts for different responsibilities
**Performance Considerations:**
- Added error notification system
- Implemented proper logging
- Created status checking capability
- Ensured proper cleanup of resources

## Process for Documenting Implementation Attempts

1. **During Development:**
   - Create a new entry in this document when starting a new feature
   - Document each significant implementation approach
   - Record issues encountered and reasons for failure
   - Document key learnings from each attempt

2. **After Success:**
   - Document the final solution and why it worked
   - Clean up all code from unsuccessful attempts
   - Reference this document in related code with brief comments
   - Update other documentation to reflect only the final approach

3. **Code Review:**
   - Reviewers should verify that unsuccessful code has been removed
   - Check that learnings have been documented
   - Ensure final solution is clean and well-documented
   - Confirm that no debugging artifacts remain
