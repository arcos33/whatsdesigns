# Documentation Management Rules

## Overview
When working on the project, continuously update and maintain documentation to ensure it remains accurate, relevant, and helpful for all team members.

## Documentation Update Guidelines

### 1. Real-time Updates
- Update relevant documentation files immediately when making significant changes to the codebase
- Document new features, components, or functionality as they are implemented
- Update API documentation when endpoints are modified
- Reflect changes in database schema when models are updated
- Document development issues and their solutions in real-time
- Update troubleshooting guides with new issues and fixes
- Log all environment-specific configurations and requirements

### 2. Documentation Creation
- Create new documentation files when identifying undocumented aspects of the project
- Follow the established structure in the index.md file
- Ensure new documentation aligns with existing documentation style and format
- Add appropriate cross-references to related documentation
- Create issue-specific documentation when encountering new problems
- Document environment-specific setup requirements

### 3. Documentation Quality
- Be clear and concise in all documentation
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include practical examples where appropriate
- Keep technical details accurate and up-to-date
- Use proper markdown formatting for readability
- Include error messages and their solutions
- Document environment-specific configurations

### 4. Documentation Organization
- Place new documentation in appropriate sections as defined in index.md
- Update index.md when adding new documentation files
- Maintain logical grouping of related documentation
- Use clear and descriptive file names
- Keep development issues and solutions in a dedicated section
- Organize troubleshooting guides by environment

### 5. Documentation Maintenance
- Review and update documentation during code reviews
- Remove outdated or incorrect information
- Add notes about deprecated features or upcoming changes
- Keep documentation in sync with the current state of the project
- Update troubleshooting guides with new solutions
- Maintain environment-specific documentation

### 6. Code Cleanup
- Remove code from unsuccessful implementation attempts once a working solution is found
- Document unsuccessful approaches in the troubleshooting guide, not in the code
- Include only the final working solution in production code
- Add comments explaining why certain approaches were chosen over others
- Remove debugging code, console logs, and testing code before committing
- Keep code clean, readable, and free of commented-out blocks
- Document complex workarounds with clear explanations

### 7. Experimentation Workflow
- Create separate feature branches for experimental approaches
- Delete unsuccessful experiment branches after documenting learnings
- Keep unsuccessful code attempts in the documentation, not in the codebase
- When multiple approaches were tried, document each with pros/cons
- Include reasons why the final approach was chosen
- Document performance implications of different approaches
- Reference key learnings from failed attempts in technical documentation

### 8. Documentation Types to Maintain
