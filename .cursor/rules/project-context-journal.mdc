When starting a new chat, always check for and read the dev-journal.md file in the workspace. Use this as the primary source of context for the project's current state, requirements, and next steps. The journal contains:
- Environment setup details
- Project requirements
- Technical stack decisions
- Project setup progress
- Next steps
- Important notes

Always continue from where the journal left off and update it as we make progress.
